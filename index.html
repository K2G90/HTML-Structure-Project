    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that</p><br/>
    I have read over the years.

    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)
    175g of tahini
    6 sundried tomatoes
    Half a red pepper
    A pinch of cayenne pepper
    1 clove of garlic
    A dash of olive oil

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</p>
    <p>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</p>
    <p>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</p>
    <p>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</p>
    <p>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</p>
    <p>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</p>

    <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>

    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've</p>
    </p>made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

    <h2>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</h2>
